# Book Search App

## Description:
The Book Search App is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API. Users can search for books by typing in a query, view the search results in real-time, and add books to their personal bookshelf. The app also provides a separate page to display the user's bookshelf, where they can see the books they've added.

## Steps to Run the Project:

    Clone the Repository:
    Clone the project repository from the GitHub repository using the following command:


## git clone https://github.com/NIYAZ04/booksapi

Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:



cd book-search-app
npm install

or

bash

cd book-search-app
yarn install

Run the Development Server:
Start the development server to run the application locally. This command will compile the code and open the application in your default web browser.

### npm start

or

### yarn start

Interact with the Application:
Once the development server is running, you can interact with the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser. You can search for books by typing in the search input field, view the search results, and add books to your personal bookshelf. You can also navigate to the My Bookshelf page to view the books you've added.

Explore the Codebase:
Feel free to explore the codebase to understand how the application works. The main logic is implemented in the BookSearch.js and Bookshelf.js components located in the src/components directory. The App.js file manages the routing and navigation between different pages of the application.

Make Modifications :
If you wish to make modifications to the application, you can do so by editing the existing code or adding new features. You can also customize the styling by modifying the CSS files located in the src directory.

Build for Production (Optional):
If you want to deploy the application to a production environment, you can build the application using the following command:


###  npm run build

or

### yarn build

This command will create a production-ready build of the application in the build directory, which you can then deploy to a web server or hosting platform.

  
Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed on your system before running the project. You also need an active internet connection to fetch data from the Open Library API.
